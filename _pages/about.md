# üë§ About Me
I am currently engaged in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), specializing in applications within the realm of communication.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in June 2020 from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC). Building upon this foundation, I furthered my education at the Research Center for Intelligent Internet of Things at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) (SJTU), where I earned my Master‚Äôs degree in March 2023 under the guidance of Professor [Dongyao Chen](https://chendy.tech/).

I won the honorary title of "outstanding graduate of Shanghai Jiao Tong University" in 2023.

My research interests include mobile sensing and wearable computing. I have published three papers at the top international computer conferences such as MobiCom and UbiComp.

[MagDot: Drift-free, Wearable Joint Angle Tracking at Low Cost](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631423)

Dongyao Chen, **Qing Luo**, Xiaomeng Chen, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou

[paper](files/MagDot.pdf)

MagDot introduces a magnetic-based, drift-free method for wearable joint angle tracking, achieving high accuracy in applications such as VR/AR, sports monitoring, and medical rehabilitation. Tested with a professional motion capture system, MagDot demonstrates precision of 2.72¬∞, 4.14¬∞, and 4.61¬∞ for elbow, knee, and shoulder, respectively, while consuming only 98mW, enabling all-day use with a small battery pack.

[Automatic calibration of magnetic tracking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3495243.3558760)

Mingke Wang<sup>*</sup>, **Qing Luo**<sup>*</sup>, Yasha Iravantchi, Xiaomeng Chen, Alanson Sample, Kang G Shin, Xiaohua Tian, Xinbing Wang, Dongyao Chen

[paper](files/MAGIC.pdf)

MAGIC is an automatic calibration system for MEMS magnetometers that addresses soft- and hard-iron disturbances without user intervention. It uses an auto-triggering mechanism to detect environmental changes and recalibrate, improving tracking accuracy efficiently. MAGIC outperforms traditional methods with minimal overhead and user involvement.
